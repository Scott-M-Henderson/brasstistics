Summary: Off to see the Wizard (David Thornton) at the RNCM International Brass Band Festival. International means Manchester these days...

Tomorrow I dare to leave Lancaster and head to the big smoke, Manchester, for The Royal Northern College of Music [International Brass Band Festival](https://www.rncm.ac.uk/festivals/rncm-international-brass-band-festival/) Spearheaded by David Thornton. This year the event celebrates [Philip Sparke](https://www.philipsparke.com/biography) in this his 75th year. I will attend the performances of Glenn Van Looy and Yasuaki Fukuhara who are accompanied by Tredegar Town Band. 

I also intend to see the first half of Black Dyke Band's performance. Due to a lack of Northern Rail trains late at night, that will be all I can see. One world premier is still a lot all the same!
